# **Who am I ?**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a modeller looking for new adventure. after an academic curriculum and a PhD in bioinformatics and biostatistics, I joined the world of startups in which I have been evolving for about a decade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my thesis, I decided to focus on product design thanks to the opportunity to propose and develop my own subject. From then, I favour projects at a very early stage, and in new domains to bring a new vision while learning the new concepts of the profession.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always been very involved in community life, as a student I participated in competitions [[1]](#iGEM) and I was the only student admitted to a national research group in synthetic biology[[2]](#GDR). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I have moved on to the organization and animation of events, whether scientific, 
former organizer of the meetup big data science Montpellier[[3]](#BDSM), lecturer in the university diploma in data management and management[[4]](#ISDM).

Or technical member of the Montpellier Tech Hub[[5]](#Techhub) which organizes the life of the tech meetup and Sunny Tech, the first tech conference in tech conference in Montpellier[[6]](#sunny).

# **What can I offer you?**
+ More than 15 years of professional experience in statistical modeling, machine & deep learning and IA. 
- My multidisciplinary thinking skills, mixing boolean (computer science), probabilistic, and diversity (biology) thinking.
- My knowledge in various fields: biotechnology, medtech, adtech, deeptech video image and sound. 
- Expertise in product design, idea formalization, and concept maturation..
- Habits of early stage startups, and pitfalls to avoid. 
- My best practices acquired in ISO certified environments.
- My professional network


# **What am I looking for?**
- A team, and leaders who like to be challenged.
- Challenges to overcome in data sciences.  
- To make ideas concrete, to go from the blank sheet to the product.
- In biotech, medtech, ecology, accessibility, inclusiveness, social, but not only...
- A partnership with the university (in progress, or to be created).
- Montpellier (France) or Full remote (more than 2 years on full remote)
